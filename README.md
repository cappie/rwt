# RWT
A RimWorld translation tool

Import the rwt.sql to a 'rwt' database with a user/pass combi 'rwt'/'rwt' in order to have the required DB.

Feel free to submit pull requests, it the code works out and doesn't do anything scary, I'll even host it @ http://rwt.gamechat.nl/

If you want to contribute or just added a pull request, please post @ https://ludeon.com/forums/index.php?topic=6825.msg66917 to keep this thread live.. I've enabled email notifications for that thread as well :)

And again: This tool is in NO way associated with Ludeon Studios ... (but Tynan seems to like it, so we might be on to something :))
